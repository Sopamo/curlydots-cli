# Implementation Plan: CLI Authentication and Translation Push

**Branch**: `005-cli-auth` | **Date**: 2025-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-cli-auth/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Browser-based authentication system with token management and JSON translation data push functionality. Implements long polling authentication with OS keychain integration and CI/CD environment support.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (per constitution)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Bun.js runtime, OS keychain libraries, HTTP client  
**Storage**: Encrypted local files + OS keychain + environment variables  
**Testing**: bun test (per constitution)  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
**Project Type**: Single CLI project  
**Performance Goals**: <60s authentication, <10s push for 1MB data  
**Constraints**: Must support CI/CD environments, browser-based auth, long polling  
**Scale/Scope**: Individual CLI users, up to 1000 translation entries per operation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
